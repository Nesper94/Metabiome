Welcome to Metabiome's documentation!
=====================================

Metabiome is a pipeline designed to make easier the study and analysis of
microbial communities from metagenomic sequence data. Metabiome incorporates
high quality software tools that perform main steps in metagenomic analysis:

- Preprocessing of reads
- Taxonomic profiling
- Taxonomic binning
- Functional profiling
- 16S extraction
- Genome assembly
- Genome binning
- Bin refinement

Why this is important?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The pipeline allows you to profile the community from a
taxonomic and functional approach based on assembled or
non-assembled sequences. It also includes a 16S gene extraction
step that gives the possibility to carry out comparative
analyzes, in relation to abundance, between the bacterial
composition of a sample analyzed from different approaches.
